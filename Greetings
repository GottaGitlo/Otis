there's a wall there. I've broken out of windows a long time ago, but being/n
completely overwhelmed by linux commands, and being mostly a gamer, it was more/n
convenient for me to be on windows. However, everytime, I hit same wall trying to break/n
out of windows. I could never get the damn gcc to work on windows. I could follow a/n
guide completely, it either doesn't auto-install or it doesn't have an installer/n
or there's some missing file, the path is wrong, etc etc.n/n/
Going back to my first lesson: Sometimes you gotta around the wall, comme back/n
when you have better tools. Does the wall always have to come down?*/
