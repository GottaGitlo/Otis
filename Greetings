/*Traditionally, everybody's first program should be "Hello, World."
It's symbolically introducing yourself, physically and mentally into cyberspace.
I know this because I was taught how to code. I knew how to code.
I used to design my own webpages when I was 12-13, and I was trying to read
HTML source code in the browser. I remember how these codes can get deeply personal.*/
